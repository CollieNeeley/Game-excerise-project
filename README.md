Breif Introduction


I am a 2024 graduate with a profound interest in technology and a dedication to solving complex problems. I look forward to expanding my technical and coding abilities vastly beyond myself, by continuosly learning strategies and dedication for organization growth. 

## Objective

My journey in computer science has led me to develop a passion for Front End Web Development, and i am now eager to transition into this field, specifically aiming to join fellow developers in Front-End and grow my knowledge and be a apart of something big.


## About this project 
Through these screenshots below i will describe what is what and why. This project was for my final grade for my course and schooling for Tri - County Technical College. It is demonstrating a fully functional website with the aviability to play a math facts pratice game by choicing multiplication, division, addition, and subtraction. 


## Tools 
I developed a fully functional and web responsive website using HTML, CSS, and Javascript according to my requirements, rules, and specifications by my Tri - County Technical College classes
